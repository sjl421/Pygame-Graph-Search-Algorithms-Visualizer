# Pygame Graph Search Algorithms Visualizer
Visualization of many famous graph search algorithms using pygame

## About Pygame
> Pygame is a cross-platfrom library designed to make it easy to write multimedia software, such as games, in Python.
> Pygame requires the Python language and SDL multimedia library. It can also make use of several other popular libraries.

### Running the algorithms visualizer
Clone the project and then write this in the console:
```
python main.py
```
After this, you will be able to navigate through all the different algorithms using the
graphical user interface

## Currently implemented algorithms
* [Breadth-first search] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search): Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.
